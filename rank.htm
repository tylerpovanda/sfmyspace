<!-- reel -->

<span style="color: white; font: courier">
	so do you really think im dying alone? well i sure hope so!

<!-- 
If you don’t like what you see, 
go ahead, take my hand and make a deathwish with me
Never going to leave,
So let’s stay and burn the whole damn world just to stare at the flames
If Death makes you afraid,
then let’s go and put a face to the name, and then we’ll put it to shame
I don’t need to be saved,
Just take me to my grave baby
Bury Me! Here! Tonight!
